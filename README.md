# Movie Recommendation System

With the proliferation of streaming platforms and increased availability of content, users are faced with a vast array of films, which can make
decision-making challenging. In this context, a film recommendation system based on user preferences
offers an effective solution to help users discover new films that match their personal tastes. This project
aims to develop such a system, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to analyze user viewing
habits and recommend similar films based on their preferences. By focusing on films liked by the user as
well as those in the same style, this system aims to enhance the cinematic discovery experience for users.

# Getting Started

In order to execute the code properly you will need to clone the repo with all its depencies especially the 
folder [dataset](dataset/) and its csv files that will help to our models to be train properly.

1. Download the project by cloning the repository :
   
  1. Open the project in any IDE (pycharm is recommended as is was built in it)
     
  2. According to the file you want to execute depencies will vary main dependencies are numpy, pandas and
     scikit-learn, you can download these third-party librairies by typing in terminal `pip install <library name>`

     
2. Once installation is done you are good to go and you can simply execute the code to see what movie is recommended :
   
   1. It is recommended to first execute the mainDemo.py as it is the easiest to use

   2. To set user's parameter (that is to say what movies the user rated and which note has been given) you can change the
      `test_user` variable in the 'Using the models' section.
